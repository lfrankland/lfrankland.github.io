        <Text>
          The Enable LMS is an enterprise-level learning platform, designed to
          facilitate the eLearning delivery across many different sectors and
          audiences, from individual learners to multi-national organisations.
          My goal was to ensure it could meet all these needs effectively,
          giving learners, training professionals and Virtual College staff the
          tools and abilities to exceed their expectations.

          It was identified that the Virtual Collegeâ€™s Enable LMS platform
          needed rebuilding from the ground up to replace the existing system.
          The key tenets were that the new system had to be responsive for
          multiple device types and accessible for a varied audience.

        <Text>
          As Virtual College had an existing system, we quickly identified the
          core functionality we would need to replace. Speaking to customers,
          stakeholders and the wider organisation, we prioritised these to
          deliverable features which were designed and developed.

        <Text>
          For each of the key features, I facilitated the ideation process
          amongst product owners and developers. Creating wireframes from these
          workshops which then fedback into iterative workshops to define the
          solution we would deliever.

          Design
        </Text>

        <Text>
          As well as designing each of the features, I also kept a holistic view
          of the application, ensuring that existing features could be utilised
          where appropriate. I also implemented a rebrand of Enable LMS when the
          organisation's brand was updated, ensuring it still met our
          accessibility targets.
