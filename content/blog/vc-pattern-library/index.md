## About the Virtual College Pattern Library
The VC Pattern Library was used to deliever front-end components across multiple products and services for different sectors and audiences. 

## The challenge
To ensure consistent front-end development in the rapid creation and testing of new products and features.

## The solution
The [Virtual College Frontend Pattern Library](https://virtualcollege.github.io/vc-app-patterns/#/) was used to rapidly build new features and standardise the development process across multiple applications. The goal was to facilitate consistency, reusability and reduce maintenance.

### Accessibility
The VC Pattern Library is used for products across different sectors. Each component was was built and tested to meet the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) AA 2.1 standard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

As well as meeting the standards, I also worked to ensure browser compatibility by testing components and layouts across multiple devices and browsers, identifying and resolving issues efficiently. 

### Methodology
Each component is made up of HTML and CSS. Using [Block Element Modifier](http://getbem.com/) name convention to decouple the HTML and CSS. Implementing this provided a flat, CSS structure which was more performant, no CSS conflicts and ease of code maintenance.

Starting with the core user interface elements, I added, amended and improved the library, ensuring that quality standards were always met.

## Practice & Adoption
I facilitated the moving from the legacy front-end system to the created, running workshops with fellow developers, helping them understand the principles of the pattern library. As well as documenting each of the components and the best practice for each, I also worked directly on applications to ensure it's smooth deployment.
